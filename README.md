# Lego Battles

This project aims to recreate the source code for Lego Battles by decompiling its code by hand. **The repository does not contain assets or assembly code.** To build the ROM, you must own an existing copy of the game to extract assets from.

This repo used [The Phantom Hourglass Decomp Repo](https://github.com/zeldaret/ph) as a template, please create issues for any remnants that should be changed.

> [!NOTE]
> The project targets the European version, and other versions might be supported later.
